  This is my first "real" coding project while learning my first programming language. It is a basic console program that is a stats 
program that imports NBA players from a text file. Users can search for players by name and view basic and some advanced stats, such as 
Player Efficency Rating (PER). The main goals were to incorporate basic concepts of programming such as loops, decision structures, 
functions, classes, sub-classes, read files, etc.
